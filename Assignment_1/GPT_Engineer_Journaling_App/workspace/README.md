Assumptions:

1. The webapp will be a simple journaling application where users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their journal entries.
2. The backend will be implemented using Python Flask, a lightweight web application framework.
3. The frontend will be implemented using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
4. The application will use a SQLite database for data persistence.
5. The application will not include user authentication for simplicity.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

Backend (Python Flask):
1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of the Flask application. It will contain the main Flask app and the routes for the CRUD operations.
2. `models.py`: This file will contain the SQLAlchemy model for the Journal Entry.
3. `db.py`: This file will contain the SQLAlchemy database instance and the initialization function.

Frontend (React):
1. `App.js`: This is the main component of the React application. It will contain the Router and the main layout.
2. `JournalEntryList.js`: This component will display a list of all journal entries.
3. `JournalEntryForm.js`: This component will display a form for creating and updating journal entries.
4. `api.js`: This file will contain the functions for making API requests to the backend.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

Backend:

app.py
